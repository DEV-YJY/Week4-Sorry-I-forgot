## Reflection
Initially the team was hoping to build a classic memory card game that allows user to click on a card at a time and get a point if the pair matches. However, the logic to get the game working was a little more complicated than we anticipated and was difficult to achieve within a given time frame. It was discouraging that the team faced a huge roadblocks on the way but the vibe was good and we enjoyed the overall project. Hope each of us learnt something from it :)
